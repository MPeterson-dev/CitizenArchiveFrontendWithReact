# Citizen Archive Frontend with React
The Citizen Archive project demonstrates my ability to create a full-stack web application by integrating multiple technologies, including React, Angular, C#, and Express. This project showcases my skills in building responsive interfaces, designing and implementing RESTful APIs, and managing backend data with a MySQL database. Alongside the primary React frontend, I am developing additional frontends in Angular and C#, each interacting with the same Express backend to offer a consistent and scalable user experience.

Purpose:

This project highlights key concepts I mastered, including:

Frontend Development: React components, responsive UI with Bootstrap, and API integration.
Backend Development: RESTful API creation with Node.js and Express.
Database Management: Data structuring, querying, and management using MySQL.
Project Structure & Version Control: Organized codebase and GitHub for collaboration and version management.

CitizenArchiveFrontendWithReact is the frontend component of the Citizen Archive project, built with React in Visual Studio Code. This application provides an educational content management system, allowing users to explore various subjects and topics. It connects to the backend server (CitizenArchiveBackendWithExpress) and a MySQL database for data management.
